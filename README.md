# 🧪 DevOps Scripting Sandbox

Welcome to my personal scripting and DevOps sandbox!  
This repository is a curated collection of practice scripts and configuration files using:

- 🐚 Bash
- 🐍 Python
- 💻 C Programming
- ☸️ Kubernetes
- 🐳 Docker
- ⚙️ Jenkins

## 🧭 Purpose

This repo is designed as a hands-on learning environment where I:
- Practice system scripting with Bash and Python.
- Write C programs to understand low-level system interactions.
- Manage containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Automate workflows using Jenkins pipelines.
- Document notes, tips, and references for quick lookup.

## 📂 Folder Overview

### `bash/`
Scripts ranging from basic syntax to advanced text processing and automation.

### `python/`
Python programs focusing on file handling, CLI tools, and scripting utilities.

### `c/`
Practice programs in C to strengthen understanding of memory management and system calls.

### `kubernetes/`
K8s manifest files, deployments, and service configurations to simulate cluster setup.

### `docker/`
Dockerfiles and Compose configurations for building and running local containers.

### `jenkins/`
Sample declarative pipelines, freestyle jobs, and shared library examples.

### `notes/`
Cheatsheets and summaries for quick reference while working on different technologies.

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the repo and explore each directory. Most scripts include usage comments or a `README.md` in their subfolder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bash-python-sandbox.git
cd bash-python-sandbox
```

- Run Bash scripts:
```bash
bash bash/automation-scripts/backup.sh
```

- Run Python scripts:
```bash
python3 python/scripting/json_parser.py
```

- Build and run C code:
```bash
gcc c/basics/hello.c -o hello && ./hello
```

- Deploy k8s manifes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployments/myapp.yaml
```

- Run Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/compose/app.yaml up
```
