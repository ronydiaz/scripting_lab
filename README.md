# 🧪 Bash-Python-C DevOps Sandbox

Welcome to my personal scripting and DevOps sandbox!  
This repository is a curated collection of practice scripts and configuration files using:

- 🐚 Bash
- 🐍 Python
- 💻 C Programming
- ☸️ Kubernetes
- 🐳 Docker
- ⚙️ Jenkins

## 🧭 Purpose

This repo is designed as a hands-on learning environment where I:
- Practice system scripting with Bash and Python.
- Write C programs to understand low-level system interactions.
- Manage containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Automate workflows using Jenkins pipelines.
- Document notes, tips, and references for quick lookup.
